# My Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website! This is a simple website I created using HTML and basic CSS to showcase my skills, projects, and provide a way for visitors to get in touch with me.

## Pages

### Home
The home page is designed to give visitors an overview of who I am, my background, and the skills I possess. It also features some of my key projects and achievements.

### Contact
The contact page is where visitors can find information on how to reach out to me. Whether it's for collaboration, job opportunities, or just to say hello, this page provides the necessary contact details and a contact form for ease of communication.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository: `link`
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the home page.
3. Navigate to the `contact.html` file to access the contact page.

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a template for your own portfolio. If you have any suggestions or find any issues, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Happy coding!
